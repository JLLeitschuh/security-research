[SECURITY] Fix Temporary Directory Hijacking or Information Disclosure Vulnerability

# Security Vulnerability Fix

This pull request fixes either 1.) Temporary Directory Hijacking Vulnerability, or 2.) Temporary Directory Information Disclosure Vulnerability, which existed in this project.

## Preamble

The system temporary directory is shared between all users on most unix-like systems (not MacOS, or Windows). Thus, code interacting with the system temporary directory must be careful about file interactions in this directory, and must ensure that the correct file permissions are set.

This PR was generated because the following chain of calls was detected in this repository in a way that leaves this project vulnerable.
`File.createTempFile(..)` -> `file.delete()` -> either `file.mkdir()` or `file.mkdirs()`.

## Temporary Directory Hijacking

This vulnerability exists because the return value from `file.mkdir()` or `file.mkdirs()` is not checked to determine if the call sucseeded. Say, for example, because another local user created the directory before this process.

```java
File tmpDir = File.createTempFile("temp", ".dir", parent); // Attacker knows the full path of the directory that will be later created
// delete the file that was created
tmpDir.delete(); // Attacker sees file is deleted and begins a race to create their own directory before the java code.
// and makes a directory of the same name
// üèÅ SECURITY VULNERABILITY: Race Condition! - Attacker beats java code and now owns this directory
tmpDir.mkdirs(); // This method returns 'false' because it was unable to create the directory. No exception is thrown.
// Attacker can write any new files to this directory that they wish.
// Attacker can read any files created by this process.
```
