[SECURITY] Fix Partial Path Traversal Vulnerability

# Security Vulnerability Fix

This pull request fixes a partial-path traversal vulnerability due to an insufficient path traversal guard.

Even if you deem, as the maintainer of this project, this is not necessarily fixing a security vulnerability, it is still a valid security hardening.

## Preamble

### Impact

This issue allows a malicious actor to potentially break out of the expected directory. The impact is limited to sibling directories. For example, `userControlled.getCanonicalPath().startsWith("/usr/out")` will allow an attacker to access a directory with a name like `/usr/outnot`. 

### Why?

To demonstrate this vulnerability, consider `"/usr/outnot".startsWith("/usr/out")`.
The check is bypassed although `/outnot` is not under the `/out` directory.
It's important to understand that the terminating slash may be removed when using various `String` representations of the `File` object.
For example, on Linux, `println(new File("/var"))` will print `/var`, but `println(new File("/var", "/")` will print `/var/`;
however, `println(new File("/var", "/").getCanonicalPath())` will print `/var`.

### The Fix

Comparing paths with the `java.nio.files.Path#startsWith` will adequately protect againts this vulnerability.

For example: `file.getCanonicalFile().toPath().startsWith(BASE_DIRECTORY)` or `file.getCanonicalFile().toPath().startsWith(BASE_DIRECTORY_FILE.getCanonicalFile().toPath())`

# :arrow_right: Vulnerability Disclosure :arrow_left:

:wave: Vulnerability disclosure is a super important part of the vulnerability handling process and should not be skipped! This may be completely new to you, and that's okay, I'm here to assist!

First question, do we need to perform vulnerability disclosure? It depends!

 1. Is the vulnerable code only in tests or example code? No disclosure required!
 2. Is the vulnerable code in code shipped to your end users? Vulnerability disclosure is probably required!

For partial path traversal, consider if user-supplied input could ever flow to this logic. If user supplied input could reach this conditional, it's  insufficient and, as such, most likely a vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Disclosure How-To

You have a few options options to perform vulnerability disclosure. However, I'd like to suggest the following 2 options:

 1. Request a CVE number from GitHub by creating a repository-level [GitHub Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory). This has the advantage that, if you provide sufficient information, GitHub will automatically generate Dependabot alerts for your downstream consumers, resolving this vulnerability more quickly.
 2. Reach out to the team at Snyk to assist with CVE issuance. They can be reached at the [Snyk's Disclosure Email](mailto:report@snyk.io). Note: Please include `JLLeitschuh Disclosure` in the subject of your email so it is not missed.

## Detecting this and Future Vulnerabilities

You can automatically detect future vulnerabilities like this by enabling the free (for open-source) [GitHub Action](https://github.com/github/codeql-action).

I'm not an employee of GitHub, I'm simply an open-source security researcher.

## Why didn't you disclose privately (ie. coordinated disclosure)?

This PR was automatically generated, in-bulk, and sent to this project as well as many others, all at the same time.

This is technically what is called a "Full Disclosure" in vulnerability disclosure, and I agree it's less than ideal. If GitHub offered a way to create private pull requests to submit pull requests, I'd leverage it, but that infrastructure, sadly, doesn't exist yet.

The problem is that as an open source software security researcher, I (exactly like open source maintainers), I only have so much time in a day. I'm able to find vulnerabilities impacting hundreds, or sometimes thousands of open source projects with tools like GitHub Code Search and CodeQL. The problem is that my knowledge of vulnerabilities doesn't scale very well.

Individualized vulnerability disclosure takes time and care. It's a long and tedious process, and I have a significant amount of experience with it (I have over 50 CVEs to my name). Even tracking down the reporting channel (email, Jira, ect..) can take time and isn't automatable. Unfortunately, when facing prblems of this scale, individual reporting doesn't work well either.

Additionally, if I just spam out emails or issues, I'll just overwhelm already over taxed maintainers, I don't want to do this either.

By creating a pull request, I am aiming to provide maintainers something highly actionable to actually fix the identified vulnerability; a pull request.

## Opting-Out

If you'd like to opt-out of future automated security vulnerability fixes like this, please consider adding a file called
`.github/GH-ROBOTS.txt` to your repository with the line:

```

This bot will respect the [ROBOTS.txt](https://moz.com/learn/seo/robotstxt) format for future contributions.

Alternatively, if this project is no longer actively maintained, consider [archiving](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-archiving-repositories) the repository.

## CLA Requirements

_This section is only relevant if your project requires contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for external contributions._

It is unlikely that I'll be able to directly sign CLAs. However, all contributed commits are already automatically signed-off.

> The meaning of a signoff depends on the project, but it typically certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under the same license and agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin
